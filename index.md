## Translation that listens before it speaks

I am an Audiovisual and Literary Translator focused on delivering language that feels natural, precise, and culturally aware.

My work combines **translation, analytical reading, and quality assurance** to ensure that every text maintains its original voice while becoming fully accessible to new audiences.

### Specializations

- Audiovisual Translation (Subtitling & Dialogue Adaptation)
- Literary Translation
- Textual Analysis and Editing
- Localization Quality Assurance (LQA)

### Approach

I believe translation is both a technical and creative discipline.  
My process balances linguistic accuracy, narrative sensitivity, and usability.
