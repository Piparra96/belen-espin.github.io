## About Belén Espín

I am an Audiovisual and Literary Translator with a strong interest in how language shapes narrative experience.

My professional path reflects a transition toward a career centered on language, analysis, and cross-cultural communication. This shift has allowed me to combine technical precision with creative interpretation.

I specialize in:

- Audiovisual Translation
- Literary Translation
- Textual Analysis
- Editing and Quality Evaluation

Alongside translation, I also work with **Localization Quality Assurance**, applying structured review processes to ensure linguistic accuracy and usability across localized content.

### Working Style

- Detail-oriented and research-driven  
- Respectful of authorial voice  
- Focused on clarity, tone, and audience experience  

I am particularly interested in projects that require both analytical depth and creative sensitivity.
